Team Spirit Customized Shirts

Team Spirit Personalized Shirts Inc. has commissioned you to create a program to be used by their employees to
track the orders for personalized shirts that are received in the shop. Part of the information that their customers
need is when their orders can be picked-up, thus the program will also compute how long it takes to process the
customer’s order, including when they can be picked up. Below are the information needed in relation to the
business processes.
An order has the same specs, i.e., same size, same position and number of add-ons. There should be a minimum of
5 pcs per order. If minimum is not met, the employee (and therefore, the program) cannot accept the order.

L (large), and X (extra large). The pricing is as follows:

o 80/pc, if minimum order is for 300 pcs and at most 500 pcs
